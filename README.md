# Class, Homeownership, and Clean Energy Attitudes (CES 2024)

[Read the brief](docs/brief/)

This project analyzes support for clean energy and environmental policy using nationally representative survey data from the 2024 Cooperative Election Study (CES).

Using weighted descriptive analysis and regression models, the project shows that **homeownership is associated with lower support for clean energy policies even after controlling for party identification, ideology, income, and education**.

## Contents
- **Analysis notebook** (`notebooks/01_main_analysis.ipynb`): Data processing, model estimation, and figure generation.
- **Results brief** (`docs/brief/`): A short, public-facing summary of findings with figures and regression tables.
- **Methods appendix** (`notebooks/03_methods_appendix.ipynb`): Documentation of data sources, variable construction, and model specifications.

## Data
The analysis uses the CES 2024 Common Content. All results are weighted using the survey-provided weights. No raw data are redistributed in this repository.

## Key takeaway
Climate policy attitudes are shaped not only by ideology and partisanship, but also by material position—particularly housing tenure—suggesting that class dynamics matter for understanding public support for environmental policy.
